# Binary Classification Predicting Crypto Market Trends using Machine Learning Models
This repository contains the project for the CSC481 class. The project Binary Classification Predicting Crypto Market Trends using Machine Learning Models

Abstract
The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, making it challenging for traders and investors to make informed decisions. This project aims to leverage machine learning models to perform binary classification on social media content, predicting whether cryptocurrency prices will rise or fall within a specified timeframe based off this data. By analyzing historical market trends and integrating relevant financial indicators, our model seeks to enhance predictive accuracy and provide data-driven insights for traders. We will implement our solution using Python, utilize X, Kraken’s, and Reddit's API to pull real-time market data, ensuring up-to-date and dynamic predictions
# Introduction

**Purpose**  
This project leverages machine learning models to perform binary classification on social media content, predicting whether cryptocurrency prices will rise or fall within a specified timeframe. By analyzing historical market trends and integrating relevant financial indicators, the model aims to enhance predictive accuracy and offer data-driven insights for traders. The solution utilizes Python, along with real-time data from X, Kraken’s, and Reddit’s APIs, ensuring dynamic and up-to-date predictions.
**Problem Statement**  
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, making it challenging for traders and investors to make informed decisions. Fluctuations can occur rapidly due to market sentiment and external factors, often leading to significant financial risk. By combining machine learning techniques with social media sentiment analysis, this project seeks to address these challenges and support more confident, evidence-based trading strategies.
